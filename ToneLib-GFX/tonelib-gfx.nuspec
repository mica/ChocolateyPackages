What is Tonelib GFX?
---
ToneLib GFX is a collection of guitar amps, speaker cabinets and effects implemented in software for use with your computer, Windows PC, Mac or Linux. The software comes as a standalone application and as plug-ins for use with the most popular DAW (digital audio workstation) recording software.

The plug-in and standalone versions offer the same function and sound, but the standalone version also offers a rhythm and backing track player, plus a built-in recorder so you can capture your ideas at the moment of inspiration. Both the standalone and plug-in versions are included when you install ToneLib GFX. Simply connect your guitar to your computer using an audio interface, and your computer is transformed into a powerful amp, effects and recording studio!
